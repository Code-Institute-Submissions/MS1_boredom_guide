- ### Design
    - #### Colour scheme
        - As the main goal of this website is to provide entertainment ideas, the colors used had to tie in with that mentallity.  
        The page is quite colorful to grab attention and invoke the sense of fun while keeping most colors quite low in saturation 
        (more muted rather than punchy, bright colors). The main color trio was picked using the color theory and those colors are a 
        navy blue (#2B3156), mint green (#A7EBDC) and muted warm red (#C76D6D). 
        Where suitable, monochromatic, complimentary colors were used, however, some pages required brighter color accents, in which case, secondary colors used were yellow (#F2E871) and fuscia (#A034B9FC).

    - #### Typography
        - Main font used is a sans-sarif type of font 'Exo' with sans-serif as a fallback font. This font is easy to read as it's not decorated and is quite wide to give off an easy-going feeling opposed to some serif fonts.
        - The secondary font used for titles is 'PT Serif' with serfi as a fallback, which creates a feeling of importance and legitimacy.
        - The font used for accents is 'neon-stream' with sans-serif as a fallback. I chose this font to go with the muted-retro colors and create retro neon arcade kind of a setting.
    
    - #### Imagery
        -(Images on this website serve two purposes. The first is to emphasise and illustrate a certain activity. And the second is to create a fun environment
        for a visitor to enjoy) have an important part to play in how we consume information and how we understand 
        it so naturally it's an important part in my website. I used a combination of graphics and 
        pictures to emphasize the meaning and type of activity described. The pictures were created 
        with a single color overlay to tie in with the color scheme and not look too distracting.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
